# TextEncrypter
Encrypts a txt file to bin using AES

You can use this to store/backup whatever info you don't want other people snooping on for peace of mind (I made this so i can keep cryptocurrency in cold storage and have all my private keys in a file that I can backup).
You can store copies of cipher.bin around on cloud storage for added peace of mind.
Just don't forget your password, and run decrypter.py once to make sure you got your password right.
Feel free to use my code or whatever.

Instructions:
Make a file (to be encrypted) called plaintext.txt in current directory.

Use encrypter.py to encrypt "plaintext.txt" to "cipher.bin"

Use decrypter.py to decrypt "cipher.bin" to "plaintext.txt"

Don't forget your password...
